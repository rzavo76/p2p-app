README.txt for StartRemotePeers

This program is for you to start your remote processes easily.

The program consists of two java files.
  StartRemotePeers.java: This is the main class for starting remote processes.
  RemotePeerInfo.java: This is the class for storing peer infomation.

Before using them, I recommend that you should look at the codes. 
Make sure that your peerProcess name is the same as the one used in this program.
If your peerProcess is written in C or C++, you must modify the StartRemotePeers.java file
a little bit as described in the file.

The procedure to use this program is as follows.

1. Modify the StartRemotePeers.java appropriately if needed.

2. Copy *.java and compileJava files to your working directory where your peerProcess resides.

3. Compile the java files as follows:
  ./compileJava

4. run the program as follows:
  java StartRemotePeers


********  IMPORTANT NOTE ********
This program was only tested on CISE SunOS environment.
If you use another environment, for example, linux environment in CISE 
or other environments not in CISE, it is not guaranteed to work properly.
It is your responsibility to adapt this program to your running environment.
